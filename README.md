## Application Description
"Puzzler" is an application created at the start of my Udacity VR Developer Nanodegree. The scene is a one level scene with the goal of the user to escape the dungeon by completing a specific rhythm based off the game "Simon Says". The code for the application was provided by, and used to better my understanding of C# scripting, Udacity and is implemented in the scene to make the user move forward, track their head position in order to follow the sequence, and back to restart the experience.

# Building and creation
The application was created using Unity 3D Patch Release 2017.1.0p4 and it can be built and ran to iOS through Xcode version 9.2 or version 9.3 Beta. The iOS device must have software version 11 and up. It also can be built and ran on Andriod devices post downloading the Andriod Studio SDK and Java JDK 8.  In order to either play the scene on desktop and build the scene the version of Unity MUST be Unity Patch Release 2017.1.0p4.
